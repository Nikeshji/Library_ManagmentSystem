--Project task
--Task 1. Create a New Book Record -- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;


--Task 2.Update an Existing Member's Address

UPDATE members
SET member_address = '125 Oak St'
WHERE member_id = 'C103';

Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table -- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE   issued_id =   'IS121';

Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee -- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.

SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101'

Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book -- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

SELECT
    issued_emp_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1


Task 6: Create Summary Tables: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(ist.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN books as b
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;

Task 7. Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category:

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';

Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category:
SELECT 
    b.category,
    SUM(b.rental_price),
    COUNT(*)
FROM 
issued_status as ist
JOIN
books as b
ON b.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY 1

--Task 9:List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days:
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';

--Task10:List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details:
SELECT 
    e1.emp_id,
    e1.emp_name,
    e1.position,
    e1.salary,
    b.*,
    e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as e1
JOIN 
branch as b
ON e1.branch_id = b.branch_id    
JOIN
employees as e2
ON e2.emp_id = b.manager_id

Task 11. Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold:

CREATE TABLE expensive_books AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7.00;

ask 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned

SELECT * FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL;

Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books
Write a query to identify members who have overdue books (assume a 30-day return period). Display the member's_id, member's name, book title, issue date, and days overdue.

SELECT 
    ist.issued_member_id,
    m.member_name,
    bk.book_title,
    ist.issued_date,
    -- rs.return_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date as over_dues_days
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN

    ON m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
LEFT JOIN 
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
WHERE 
    rs.return_date IS NULL
    AND
    (CURRENT_DATE - ist.issued_date) > 30
ORDER BY 1

--Task14: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed
Write a query to find the top 3 employees who have processed the most book issues. Display the employee name, number of books processed, and their branch.

SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    b.*,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_book_issued
FROM issued_status as ist
JOIN
employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
